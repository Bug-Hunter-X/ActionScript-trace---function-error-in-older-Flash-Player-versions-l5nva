This repository contains a simple ActionScript 3.0 example that demonstrates a runtime error encountered in older versions of Flash Player (prior to Flash Player 10). The error is related to the trace() function, which was not consistently handled across all versions.

The bug.as file shows the original code that produces the error. The bugSolution.as file demonstrates a solution that ensures compatibility with older Flash Players.
